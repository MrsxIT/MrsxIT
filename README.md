- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrsxIT
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code and use Git to then improve my coding.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basic structure of coding and what different codes may be used for. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m just looking at others work right now, as a complete beginner!
