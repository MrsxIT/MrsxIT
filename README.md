### Who is MrsxIT?

```I am new to tech and new to GitHub.```
```I am new to coding and programming languages```
```I work in data management and anaylsis```

### What am I about?

So, I am a newbie-tech-geek who enjoys playing with and working with data management. This has created a passion for using tech to make this easier, and hopefully, make me more efficient. I am interested in learning how to code and read multiple languages - I aim to then contribute to the GitHub community and show others how easy it can be.
