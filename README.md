### Who is MrsxIT?

I an new to tech and new to GitHub. I am learning how to use VS code and use GitHub and I am keen to use to show that if I can do it.. **then anyone can!** 
I have two repositories - one where we explore, together, how to use GitHub in our worklife to make us more efficient and work feel less.... Well, like *work*. The other is to explore how we can use GitHub to support our home life - making life simpler. Or thats the plan anyway.

So, I am a newbie-tech-geek who enjoys and work in data managemnet. This has created a passion for using tech to make this easier, and hopefully, more efficient. I am interested in learning how to code and read multiple languages - I aim to then contribute to the GitHub community and show others how easy it can be.
